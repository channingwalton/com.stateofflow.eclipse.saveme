I am not maintaining this any more really, so if someone would like to take it on that would be great.

h3.Overview

The Eclipse Save Me plugin is a very small Eclipse plugin that will save an unsaved editor when the editor loses focus.

You can download this plugin through our update site: http://www.stateofflow.com/UpdateSite

To use the plugin, open Eclipse’s preferences and go to the Save Me preferences and enable the auto save feature . You can search for the preference page by typing ‘save’ in the preference search box.
